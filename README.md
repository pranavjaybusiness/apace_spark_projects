## 1. Flight Delay Simulation

**Overview**  
The Flight Delay Simulation is a predictive system developed to forecast potential delays in flight schedules based on various influential factors. It harnesses the power of machine learning, leveraging a dataset spanning from 2012 to 2022, to give accurate predictions.

**Features**  
- **Predictive Analysis:** Estimate the delay time based on weather conditions, flight carrier, and other relevant variables.
- **Extensive Dataset:** Uses over 3.5 million data points from flights spanning a decade to enhance prediction accuracy.
- **Linear Regression Model:** Developed using Apache Spark for robust and scalable predictions.
- **Interactive UI (if applicable):** Easily input flight details to get delay predictions.

**Prerequisites**  
- Apache Spark
- Python 3.x
- Relevant libraries: `pyspark`, `numpy`, `pandas` (Ensure these are installed using pip)
