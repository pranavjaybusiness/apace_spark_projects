This is a collection of my projects where I utilized Apache Spark.

1. A Flight Delay Prediction software. I used linear regression on a dataset that consisted of over 2 million data entries (the data file on github only has 600,000 entries due to space issues) to predict the expected delay of a flight given
weather conditions, flight carrier, flight model, etc.
